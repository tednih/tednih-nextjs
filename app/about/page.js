      {/* ABOUT Who I Am */}
      {/* I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications that connect with API's and other backend technologies. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, NextJS, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job. */}
